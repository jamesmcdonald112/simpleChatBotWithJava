# Simple Chat Bot for Java
This project contains a simple class designed for handling user input in Java. 
The primary functionality prompts the user for their name and returns the input after basic validation.

## Features
Get User Name: Prompts users to enter their name and ensures the input is valid.

## How to Use
- Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jamesmcdonald112/simpleChatBotWithJava
```

- Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Simple Chat Bot with Java/task/src/bot
```
- Compile and run the InputManager class:

```bash
javac SimpleBot.java
java SimpleBot
```
## Note
I have already completed a similar project in JavaScript, so I didn't gain much from this exercise. It only took about 10 minutes to complete.
